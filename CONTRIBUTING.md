# Contributing to gitanizer

Thanks for taking time to make gitanizer better!

## Building gitanizer
Simply run `gradlew build`. 

## Starting gitanizer
To start gitanizer in development mode, simply run `gradlew bootrun`.
After starting, you can access the gitanizer UI in your browser via `http://localhost:8080`.

When starting via `gradlew bootrun`, gitanizer is pre-configured to mirror

the mirrors to start synchronizing the SVN repository into a git repo hosted
by gitanizer.
